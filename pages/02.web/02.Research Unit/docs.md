Research Units are the organisational units on SMIR. They are administrated by a Research Unit Administrator. Members of a Research Unit have access to a shared group folder. Every registered user is member of a least one Research Unit but can be part of multiple Research Units.

## Research Unit Administrator

The duties of a Research Unit Administrator are to accept or reject join requests.

### Accept or reject join requests

1. Login to your SMIR account.
2. [MySMIR > Group Administration](https://www.smir.ch/MyDB/GroupAdministration)
