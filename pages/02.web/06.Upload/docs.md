There are three options to choose from. HTML5 uploader is recommended!

1. Standard uploader (alternative)
2. HTML5 uploader (best)
3. Java uploader (deprecated)



## Standard uploader

- file picking, add multiple files
- cannot upload directories
- Can only upload files smaller than 500 MB



## HTML5 uploader

- Drag n drop or file picker
- Upload directories
- Can handle large files



## Java uploader

- used to upload large files
- Not recommend anymore (issues with browser compatibility etc)
