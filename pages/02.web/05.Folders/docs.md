## Folder sharing & permissions

### Permissions

Similar to the object permissions described in the previous chapter, the access to a folder can be defined with fine-grained permissions.

- **Visit** (V) allows the associated user/group to see the folder and its content.
- **Modify** (Mo) allows the associated user/group to modify the folder (e.g. add/remove content from the folder and rename it).
- **Manage** (Ma) allows the associated user/group to manage the folder (e.g. change permissions).

### Permission sets 

A permission set is a combination of multiple folder permissions.

- **Viewers** allows the associated user/group to see the folder and its content.
- **Collaborators** allows the associated user/group to modify the folder including the permissions of **Viewers**.
- **Editors** allows the associated user/group to manage the folder including the permissions of **Collaborators**.

! Object permissions are not affected by folder sharing! You only define how other users can access the folder and view the contents. Example: An object is set to private and is added to a shared folder. In this case only the owner will see the object in this folder, other users do not.
