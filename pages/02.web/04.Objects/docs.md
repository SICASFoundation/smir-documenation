# Objects

Data sets are represented as **Objects** on SMIR. Each object has a unique ID, a set of meta data and object permission. The object's ID is static. This allows you to link permanently to an object. Additionaly, SMIR offers to create a [Digital object identifier](https://www.doi.org/) (DOI). Please read the [DOI section](#doi) for details and instructions.

**Link template**

`https://www.smir.ch/Objects/ID`

**Example for ID 101597**

`https://www.smir.ch/Objects/101597`

 

There are different *object types* to represent the type of the data set. Example *object types* are:

- RAW Image like CT scan, MR Images, etc..
- Segementation of Images
- Surface models
- Genetic data

For a complete list check the [technical documentation section](http://smir-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filetypes/).



## Object names

SMIR uses a template to replace filenames after upload. This helps to identify what type of data the object represents by just looking at the name. It also removes identification information stored in the original (local) filename. The original filename is stored but only displayed to the *owner* of the object.

### Naming template

**Template**  `Namespace.Anatomy.Age.Gender.Modality.ID.Filenumber.Extension`

**Example** `SMIR.Right_scapula.56.M.OT.167141.000.stl`

-  Namespace: SMIR
-  Anatomy: Right scapula
-  Age: 56
-  Gender: male
-  Modality: Other Type (OT)
-  ID: 167141
-  Extension: STereoLithography (stl)
