## Testing Results

!!! ** The tables of results for the testing sets will update automatically every week (effectively every Monday 00:00 UTC).**

This change reflects our motivation to minimize chances of model overtraining to the testing set, which we remarked was possible before due to the instant ranking of segmentation uploads. We hope that this will ensure a better comparison of your developments and reporting to the literature.
