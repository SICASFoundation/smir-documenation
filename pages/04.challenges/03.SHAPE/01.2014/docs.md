## Scores & Ranking

We compute for each of our evaluation criteria:

- Generalization (average distance)
- Generalization (hausdorff distance)
- Specificity
- Compactness

We are ranking of the participant according to their performance (e.g. if there are 10 participants, the best performing algorithm gets 1 point and the worst performing algorithm gets 10 point). The final ranking will be the avarage of the individual rankings.
