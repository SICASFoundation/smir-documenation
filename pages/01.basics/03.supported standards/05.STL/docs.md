# STereoLithography

## Description

STL files describe only the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object without any representation of color, texture or other common CAD model attributes. The STL format specifies both ASCII and binary representations. 3D Systems’ precision healthcare capabilities include simulation, Virtual Surgical Planning, and printing of medical and dental devices as well as patient-specific surgical instruments. As the originator of 3D printing and a shaper of future 3D solutions, 3D Systems has spent its 30 year history enabling professionals and companies to optimize their designs, transform their workflows, bring innovative products to market and drive new business models.

## Framework

- 

## Processing

Users can now upload STL surface model files. The implemented model viewer allows to  preview the structure directly in the browser:

- Use the left mouse button to rotate
- The scroll wheel  to scale
- And the right mouse button to drag the model

## Accepted files
- `.stl`
- `binary` or `text`
