## Description

> A DOI identifies an object permanently, even if the object changes its location, its owner or other characteristics. The DOI does this through redirection, using the Handle system.

The DOI enables the citability data object stored on SMIR. This permanent identifier (URL) takes the user to the current version of the relevant web page. The DOI's and meta data are registered with [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) and are available for search.

## Format

DOI name is made up of a DOI prefix and a DOI suffix separated by a forward slash

- Prefix for SMIR is **10.22016**
- Suffix for SMIR object **o.SMIR-ID** (ID of the object)

The DOI name can be resolved using the [DOI Lookup](http://dx.doi.org/) or by prefixing  ** http://doi.org/ ** to the DOI name.

A correct DOI link looks like this [http://doi.org/10.22016/smir.o.217900](http://doi.org/10.22016/smir.o.217900)  and resolves to the SMIR object with ID 217900.

## Policies

- The object's metadata will be publicly accessible. 
- The DOI creation is irreversible and cannot be deleted.
- The DOI registration can take up to 48 hours (until the DOI is active)

>> Creating a DOI does not affect download permission. You only expose the meta-data (Details page) to the public.
