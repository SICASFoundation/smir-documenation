# MIAME Notation in Markup Language

## Description

MINiML (MIAME Notation in Markup Language, pronounced ‘minimal’) is a data exchange format optimized for microarray gene expression data, as well as many other types of high-throughput molecular abundance data. MINiML assumes only very basic relations between objects: Platform (e.g., array), Sample (e.g., hybridization), and Series (experiment). MINiML captures all components of the MIAME checklist, as well as any additional information that the submitter wants to provide. MINiML uses XML Schema as syntax
